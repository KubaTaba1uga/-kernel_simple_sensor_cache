#### Overview:
Imagine a scenario where user-space applications frequently read temperature data from a sensor. Reading directly from hardware every time causes latency and overhead. By introducing a kernel-level cache, your kernel module periodically fetches the sensor data, stores it in kernel memory, and efficiently provides this cached data to user-space applications upon request.

#### Workflow:
- **Kernel-side**:
  - Periodically read sensor data (using an existing kernel driver or IÂ²C APIs).
  - Cache sensor data in memory (`kmalloc`-allocated buffers).
  - Expose a simple interface (character device `/dev/sensor_cache`).

- **User-space**:
  ```bash
  cat /dev/sensor_cache
  ```
  Applications read cached sensor data quickly, without repeatedly waiting for hardware access.

#### Benefits:
- Reduces latency for sensor data retrieval.
- Minimizes hardware interaction, improving sensor lifespan.
- Demonstrates real-world practicality of kernel-level memory management.

This practical use case clearly highlights kernel memory allocation concepts and offers direct applicability in embedded or IoT-style scenario.
